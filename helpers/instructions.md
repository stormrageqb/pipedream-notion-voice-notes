## Compatibility

This workflow will work with any Notion database. It is currently configured to support **Dropbox** for audio file uploads. More cloud storage providers are coming in future releases.

### Upgrade Your Notion Experience

While this workflow will work with any Notion database, it's even better with a template.

For general productivity use, you'll love [Ultimate Brain](https://thomasjfrank.com/brain/) – my all-in-one second brain template for Notion. 

Ultimate Brain brings tasks, notes, projects, and goals all into one tool. Naturally, it works very well with this workflow.

**Are you a creator?** 

My [Creator's Companion](https://thomasjfrank.com/creators-companion/) template includes a ton of features that will help you make better-performing content and optimize your production process. There's even a version that includes Ultimate Brain, so you can easily use this workflow to create notes whenever you have an idea for a new video or piece of content.

*P.S. – This free workflow took hundreds of hours to build. If you'd like to support my work, buying one of my templates is the best way to do so!*
