## Compatibility

This workflow will work with any Notion database.

### Upgrade Your Notion Experience

While this workflow will work with any Notion database, it's even better with a template.

For general productivity use, you'll love [Ultimate Brain](https://thomasjfrank.com/brain/) – my all-in-one second brain template for Notion. 

Ultimate Brain brings tasks, notes, projects, and goals all into one tool. Naturally, it works very well with this workflow.

**Are you a creator?** 

My [Creator's Companion](https://thomasjfrank.com/creators-companion/) template includes a ton of features that will help you make better-performing content and optimize your production process. There's even a version that includes Ultimate Brain, so you can easily use this workflow to create notes whenever you have an idea for a new video or piece of content.
